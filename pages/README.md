# Pages Directory

This is an empty folder used to resolve name conflicts between `app/` and `pages/` in NextJS in order to follow Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) principles in the `src/` directory.

This configuration allows us to take advantage of Next.js' App Router functionality while adhering to FSD principles.
